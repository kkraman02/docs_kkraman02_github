## 1. Definition

BitBake is a build automation tool used to manage the compilation and packaging of software. It's commonly used in the Yocto Project to create custom Linux distributions. BitBake processes recipes, which specify how to fetch, configure, compile, and package software components, enabling reproducible and customizable builds.

## 2. Usages of the bitbake

### 2.1 bitbake (recipe)

Build a specified recipe.

```bash
bitbake core-image-minimal
```

### 2.2 bitbake -c (task) (recipe)

Execute a specific task for a recipe.
This allows you to run a particular task within a recipe. Replace(task) with the desired task (e.g., fetch, configure, compile).

```bash
bitbake -c clean core-image-minimal
```

### 2.3 bitbake-layers

Manage layers in your build environment.

```bash
bitbake-layers show-layers
```

This command lists all the layers included in your build environment.

#### 2.3.1 Add new layer to the build environment
